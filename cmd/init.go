# Config for stor

# Each aliases sub key is an alias for a storage account / container combo which is in the url
# plus its storage account key
# This is just a convenience method to shorten what is required to type
# The key itself is the alias to basically the url/key pair for the storage account
#   e.g.  //blah/filename   -> https://hhblah.blob.core.windows.net/blah/filename
#         plus it references the right "key" too so none of that has to be passed
#    or   //stor/downloads/macosx/stor -> https://hahutton.blob.core.windows.net/stor/downloads/macosx/stor
#   This means one could type: stor cp ./filename //blah/filename
#    to copy a file from the local filesystem to the Azure Storage account 
#   The net effect of this is to use "//blah/" instead of "https://hhblah.blob.core.windows.net/blah/"
#   which really is a lot less typing (plus the associated key will be used too!
#
# Once you fill out the below. It is most convenient to move it to your $HOME directory. That way you can
# use stor from anywhere. It will also check for .stor.yml in the current working directory. Plus, there is
# a command switch to pass it on the cmd line too.
# Example of a prior config (with invalid keys now :)
